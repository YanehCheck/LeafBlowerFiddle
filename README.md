# Leaf Blower Fiddle

### Compile it yourself :P

Small automation tool for Leaf Blower Revolution game made in WinForms.

The tool works as a bit over the top macro more than a cheat.
It uses Windows API to capture the game window and send mouse and keyboard input. That means it even works in the background, co you can actually use your computer while running it, unlike traditional macro!

The tool is was made as a personal project, so expect bugs on some platforms.

## Usage
